Ch 4 Programming Assignment, Part A

EMobile Phones is a new provider of cellular phone service for students at EMCC. Write a program called
    phone_service.py to help customers choose a service plan.
    Prompt the user to input the following information:

    Maximum number of "talk" minutes
    Maximum number of SMS/text messges
    Maximum amount of data, in gigabytes.

Based on the input, use branching to recommend appropriate service plan options:

    A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should accept
        Plan A at $49 per month.
    A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and any text messages--but no data--should accept
        Plan B at $55 per month.
    A customer who needs 500 or more minutes of talk and no data should accept either
        Plan C for up to 100 text messages at $61 per month or
        Plan D for 100 text messages or more at $70 per month.
    A customer who needs any data should accept
        Plan E for up to 3 gigabytes at $79 or Plan F for 3 gigabytes or more at $87.
