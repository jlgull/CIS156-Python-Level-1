Ch 4 Programming Assignment, Part B

Renee's Rad Restaurant pays employees differently depending on their job title and experience.
    In a program called payroll.py, use separate prompts to collect the following input:

    Job title ("W" for wait staff, "H" for host, "K" for kitchen staff)
    Number of hours worked
    Number of years employed at the restaurant

Then, output their gross pay amount (i.e., the amount they earn before taxes and other deductions)
    based on the following:

    Wait staff earns $5/hour until they've worked 1 year, then earn $6/hour
    Hosts earn $12/hour for the first 2 years, then go up to $13.50/hour
    Kitchen staff make $15/hour for the first year, then go to $18/hour

Note: At this stage, you do not need to worry about "rounding off" the numbers to look like currency.
    It's okay if they have an incorrect number of decimal places.
