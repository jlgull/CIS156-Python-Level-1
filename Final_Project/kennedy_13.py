# Program name: kennedy_13.py
#
# This is a module written to contain tools used in other programs
#         to reduce the duplication of code as the designed moved forward.
#         clear() - Performs a screen clear using the OS module and is intended to by Operating System (OS)
#                     independent or agnostic.
#         get_data    - Is used for all data entry requests. It uses try/except to ensure that the data
#                         entered is the correct type, it also expects a clarifying question or statement.

#
# Import all required options
#
# Import system and name from the os module.
from os import system, name
""" name    - The name of the operating system dependent module imported. 
                The following names have currently been registered: 'posix', 'nt', 'java'.
                
    system  - Execute the command (a string) in a subshell. 
                This is implemented by calling the Standard C function system(), and has the same 
                limitations. Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the
                executed command. If command generates any output, it will be sent to the interpreter
                standard output stream. The C standard does not specify the meaning of the return value 
                of the C function, so the return value of the Python function is system-dependent.

# Import sleep from the time module.
from time import sleep
""" sleep   - Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds. 
                The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. 
                The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal 
                will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signalâ€™s catching routine. 
                Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because 
                of the scheduling of other activity in the system.

Variable List

List info:
    menu_items      - List to hold menu items.

    In function:
        entered_data    - Value entered in response to data requested.
                            This value may be a "Floating Point" number, an "Integer" number
                            or "String" data.
        picked_choice   - Item picked from the menu list.
        year_choice     - The number being returned to the calling program.
