Variable List

Since there are no arrays in Python, so I used a list. Here is information about the (array) List.
List info:


String variables:

    In function:
                  
Floating point numbers:
    In main program:
  
    In function:

Integers numbers:

# Set the while control value to "Y".
do_again = "Y"

# Use while, regarding the desire to re-run the program.
while do_again != "N":

    # Main body of the program.


    # The following code as copied from the sum_loop program.
    # Ask if the user would like to repeat the program.
    # Also, validate for the correct response.
    while True:
        print("\nWould you like to calculate the sum of your bills again? Enter (Y) for yes or (N) for no.", end=" ")
        do_again = input().upper()
        if do_again == "N" or do_again == "Y":
            break
        else:
            print("The only valid entries are either a Y or an N.")

# End of program
