Ch 6 Programming Assignment, Part B

Create a program called shipping_price.py that calculates the shipping price for a purchase.
Use a prompt to get (from the user) the number of items and the total weight of the package (in pounds).
Then pass that data to a user-defined function that accepts both values as parameters and
    returns (not outputs) a shipping price based on the following guidelines:

    Less than 3 items and less than one pound: $5.00 shipping charge.
    Less than 3 items and one pound or over: $7.50 shipping charge.
    3 to 5 items and less than two pounds: $8.50 shipping charge.
    Anything else: $10.00 shipping charge.

Display this returned value for the user.
