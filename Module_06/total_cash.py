Ch 6 Programming Assignment, Part A

Create a program called total_cash.py that determines the total value of a wallet full of cash.
If should ask the user to input the quantity of each denomination of bills
    (ones, fives, etc--up to hundreds).
It should then call a function that accepts each of those values as arguments/parameters and
    returns (not prints!) the total amount of the cash.
Finally, you should output the total value for the user to see.

For example, if a user has 3 ones, 3 tens, and 1 fifty, their total is $83 in cash.
